* PCMCONT
Continues PCM playback after PCMSTOP.

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
PCMCONT
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

PCMCONT accepts an optional argument (which appears to do nothing) and returns an infinite amount of null values.

DIM A[2]
A[1]=32678
PCMSTREAM A,440
