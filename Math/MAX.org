* MAX
Finds the largest number in a list of numbers or an array

** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
MAX number_1, number_2 [, ...] OUT ma​ximum
MAX array[] OUT maxim​um
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| number_1, number_2, ... | List of numbers to find the maximum of. Must have at least 2 numbers |
| array[] | Number array to find the maximum of. Length must not be 0 |

| Output | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
| maximum | The maximum of the list/array. Will always be a float, unless you passed an integer array or 2 integers. If the maximum value occurs multiple times in the list, =MAX= returns the first occurrence.|

** Examples
#+BEGIN_SRC smilebasic
PRINT MAX(7,4,8) '8
DIM A[3]
A[0]=7
A[1]=4
A[2]=8
PRINT MAX(A) '8
#+END_SRC

** Possible Errors
| Error | Cause |
|-------+-|
| Type mismatch | The list of numbers has fewer than 2 items, or a value which isn't a number, or a string array was used. |
| Illegal function call | 0 arguments were passed, or the number of outputs was not 1, or an array with a length of 0 was used. |
