* SPUSED
Checks if a sprite exists (has been created by =SPSET=).
# lol there's a face =)
** Syntax
# use haskell as language for syntax examples as a gross workaround for github being the worst
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
SPUSED sprite% OUT exists%
#+END_SRC

# if alternate syntax is needed, list it in the same way. Use OUT for one-return forms

# describe the arguments here, if necessary.  at minimum, describe types
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------+-------------|
